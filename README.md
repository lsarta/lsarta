Hey, I’m @lsarta  
I'm working on a nonprofit CRM building, CRMblr (www.crmblr.com).
I’ve recently competed in several hackathons in SF, where I'm based. My team placed 1st at the Aparavi Hackathon May 24th (24 teams), 3rd at the AWS MCP Agents Hackathon May 30 (54 teams), and 1st at the AI Engineer World's Fair Hackathon June 1 (45 teams), and 1st and the MARA Holdings Crypto Hackathon on June 21 (40 teams, 1 BTC grand prize).
